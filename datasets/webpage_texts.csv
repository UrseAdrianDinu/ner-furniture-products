SOFA CONFIGURATION Corner sectionals fill an awkward space, U-shapes are great for
sociability in larger rooms, and a 2 or 3 seater sectional with a
moveable footstool is
perfect for smaller spaces as the footstool can double up as
another seat or a coffee table when needed.|||COMFORT Consider who'll be sitting on your sofa.|||The low seat and sloped
back of our Shabby
sectional offers a casual, slouchy seating position.|||If that's
too relaxed for you, consider a higher seat with a more upright
back such as the Scrambler sectional .|||LEATHER OR FABRIC?|||Leather is one of the most durable options, our leathers are
hand-distressed to feel warm and lived-in.|||Patterned velvets
including our Faded & Degraded range feel soft and don't stain
easily, cotton velvets have a more natural look and will scuff with
use.|||Performance linen is water-resistant and good for a busy
household.|||DAILY MAINTENANCE You can't beat feather-filled cushions such as our Nest sectional for the ultimate
sink-in comfort, but as they flatten after being sat on you will
need to plump and fluff the cushions regularly to restore their
shape.|||It doesn't take long, but if you prefer the softness with
less maintenance then opt for a feather-wrapped foam such as Oasis or Peak .|||For
sleek lines and a seat that bounces right back after use, our foam
and fibre filled options such as Cortado , Shabby , and Nirvana are for you.|||SIZE If you're not sure how big to make your sectional sofa, contact
your closest gallery and our team will
draw up a 3D room plan for you to
visualise how your sofa will fit into your space.|||READ OUR

https://www.gloster.com/en/products/materials/teak,"Gloster × View all collections Products Search Products Videos Planner Moodboard Blog Catalogue Find Store About Library MENU Teak, crafts and innovation Home Products Materials teak Teak Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content.|||This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow.|||These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications.|||Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture.|||The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.|||INDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.|||If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish.|||Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.|||OUTDOOR USE Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.|||As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away.|||After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly.|||As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak.|||We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner.|||Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface.|||Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.|||Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish.|||Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.|||If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer.|||Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance.|||If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.|||If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage.|||However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.|||To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector.|||Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.)|||penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains.|||Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.|||Collections Using Teak 180 Accessories Archi Bay Bells Block Blow Bora Carver Coso Cradle Deck Fern Grid Grid Cabana Haven Kasha Kay Lighting Lima Maya Mistral Navigator Omada Raw Saranac Sepal Sway Whirl William Zenith Follow us Gloster Furniture GmbH Tel: +49 4131 28753-0 CONTACT GLOSTER Your region: Rest of World PRIVACY STATEMENT ABOUT COOKIES IMPRINT"

pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece.|||Care Instructions ​ To clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth.|||After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth.|||Bone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use.|||Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example: https://www.bunnings.com.au/cabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368 Whilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece.|||Please do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay.|||They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces.|||If your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration.|||Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun.|||If your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use.|||The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen.|||Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen.|||For our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof.|||Unpacking Inlay products are delicately handmade and heavy in weight, which is why our products are very carefully bubble wrapped and then packaged and bolted carefully within a crate.|||During the transit and customs process, our products can be moved around numerous times, and hence it is safe to package with extra precaution to eliminate any damage.|||When the larger furniture crate arrives at your home, you will require two tools to open the crate.|||This includes a crow bar and hammer, or as a third additional option you can use a cordless drill with Phillips head attachment (or a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws is a perfectly fine alternative).|||Here is a video displaying a simple way to open your crate: https://youtu.be/c_73cP5dFWM Additional Info About Mahlia Interiors

simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.|||Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.|||It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.|||It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.|||Why do we use it?|||It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.|||The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.|||Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.|||Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).|||Choose Options this is just a warning Login Close Email Address * Password * Forgot your password?|||Create account Close Shopping Cart 0 items Close Search Search Trending Now dempus
